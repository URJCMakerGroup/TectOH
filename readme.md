# Tectonic Open Hardware (TectOH) Sandbox


![Sandbox CAD image](./imgs/cad_lateral_view_sm.png)

Low-cost Open-Hardware scientific and educational device for tectonic analogue modelling. [See Wikipedia entry on tectonic analogue modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogue_modelling_%28geology%29).

It can move at speeds from 1 mm/h to 100 mm/h.

The stroke of the gantry is 270 mm but it can be easily customized for other lenghts.

The cost of the components is no more than 500 €, although for increased performance, precision components can be used at higher cost.

It is not too complicated to build. It should be simpler than building a 3D printer or CNC.


This is the second version of the Open Hardware Sandbox. [Link to the first version](https://github.com/URJCMakerGroup/TFG-Cristina-Fernandez)

## Bill of materials

It is about 500€ without taxes and shipping costs.

There could be cheaper alternatives in your area.

You can use more expensive mechanical components to increase the overall precision of the system
